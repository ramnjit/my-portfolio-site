# My Personal Portfolio Website 🚀

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, live at **[romanboparai.com](https://romanboparai.com)**.

This site was built from scratch as a clean, fast, and fully responsive hub to showcase my software engineering projects. It is built with **Astro** and deployed automatically via **Vercel**.

## 🌟 Technical Features

This site was built to demonstrate modern web development practices:

* **Modern Framework:** Built with **Astro** for a high-performance, static-first site.
* **Component-Based Design:** Features reusable components (like the `ProjectCard`) built with `.astro` syntax.
* **Dynamic Themeing:** Includes a full **Light/Dark Mode toggle** that uses CSS Variables and JavaScript (`localStorage`) to save the user's preference.
* **Fully Responsive:** Uses **CSS Flexbox** and **Media Queries** to ensure the layout is clean and functional on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
* **Live API Integration:** The "Python ETL" project page features a live, interactive demo, using client-side JavaScript (`fetch`) to call a separately-hosted **Python/Flask API** on AWS and display the JSON results.
* **CI/CD Deployment:** Automatically deployed via **Vercel**, which triggers a new build and deployment on every push to the `main` branch.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** Astro
* **Languages:** HTML, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Styling:** CSS Variables, Flexbox, Media Queries
* **Hosting:** Vercel (linked to GitHub for CI/CD)
