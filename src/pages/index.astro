			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>I am a Senior Software Engineer with 8 years of experience bridging the gap between high-performance engineering and scalable cloud backends.</p>
			<p>With a background in AAA game development (WWE 2K series) and enterprise software, I specialize in solving complex engineering problems whether that’s managing real-time economy data for millions of players or architecting secure internal platforms for manufacturing logistics.</p>
			<p>I am a "Polyglot" engineer. I don’t stick to one stack; I pick the best tool for the job. At Carl's Place, I transitioned from C++ to Node.js, Azure, and C#, delivering a custom e-commerce backend and secure payment integrations. I bring that same rapid adaptation and architectural discipline to every project I touch.</p>
			<p><strong>Core Stack:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, C#, Node.js, SQL, C++</li>
				<li><strong>Cloud & Backend:</strong> Azure (Serverless), AWS, REST APIs, Microservices, Braintree</li>
				<li><strong>Tools & Engines:</strong> Docker, CI/CD Pipelines, Git, Perforce, Unity 3D, Unreal Engine 5</li>
			</ul>
