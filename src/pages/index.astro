			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>I am a Lead Software Engineer with over 6.5 years of experience architecting and building high-performance applications. My expertise spans both cross-platform and backend systems, with a strong foundation in C#, Java, C++, and JavaScript.</p>
			<p>My professional foundation was forged in the high-performance environment of AAA game development at Lost Boys Interactive, where I delivered full-stack features for the WWE 2K series using C++. I have since grown into a technical leadership role at Carl's Place, where I own projects from design to deployment across a versatile stack including C#, Python, and JavaScript. I stay current with modern mobile patterns through personal projects, such as a .NET MAUI application featuring native Android API integration.</p>
